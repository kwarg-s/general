On a clean work surface, pour the flour and make a well in the center.\\n2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\\n3. Using a fork, gradually mix the eggs into the flour until a dough forms.\\n4. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too dry, add a little water. If it is too wet, add a little more flour.\\n5. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions and roll each portion out into a thin sheet using a pasta machine or a rolling pin.\\n7. Cut the dough into desired shapes such as fettuccine, spaghetti, or ravioli.\\n8. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water for about 2-3 minutes or until al dente.\\n9.
